# Canyon Aeroad - Unboxing & First Look

## Out of the Box

Got the new bike. Canyon Aeroad, Dura-Ace Di2, the full works. Let's see what we've actually got here.

First thing that strikes you - it looks better in person than photos. Sparkly finish catches the light nicely. The frame has proper presence to it.

## The Wheels & Tires

Comes with DT Swiss ARC 1100 Dicut db wheels and Continental GP 5000 S TR tires. They're set up tubeless from the factory.

Got to be honest though - these OEM Contis look cheap. Properly cheap. Nothing like the ones you'd buy yourself. Makes you wonder if they actually make special budget versions for OEM spec. These are getting swapped straight away for training wheels anyway.

## That Aero Cockpit

The handlebar setup is interesting. Full carbon integrated job. Width adjustable from 37cm down to 35cm, which isn't bad really. To go full narrow you need to take the tape off, but there's literally no harm in doing it - the way it's made, there's nothing structural to worry about.

You do feel a little gap where it splits though. Bit odd. Not sure if that's good or bad yet.

The cable routing just goes straight under there. Clean. Everything's T25 bolts throughout, which is actually quite good - proper consistency.

## Lightweight Bits

Seat clamp is ridiculously light. Some of the other brands have these chunky two-bolt affairs - this is properly minimal. Very light compared to the Giant ones.

The saddle's expensive too - like £300. Too expensive for me, but it's there.

## The Seatpost

Seatpost design is unique - proper aero shape, sits way back. Once you've got it positioned right though, it looks spot on.

## Groupset & Finishing Kit

Shimano 12-speed Dura-Ace Di2 R9270. All works as it should. The derailleur hanger is one of those really strong ones that's supposed to give better shifting.

Cranks are 172.5mm. Bit long, definitely narrower Q-factor than some bikes. Even the rubber boots on the hoods are better than the ugly ones they usually stick on.

## Tire Clearance

Claims 34mm in the back, and I reckon they'll fit. Measured looks about right.

## Weight

Scales say 7.2kg without pedals or bottle cages. That's mental really. Properly light for a full aero bike with Dura-Ace.

## Build Quality

Frame looks solid. Chunky down tube. The whole thing feels well put together straight from the box. When it's slammed with better wheels on it, it's going to look proper.

## Missing Bits

Should have come with bottle cages according to the spec, but can't find them anywhere. Typical. There's a tool in there somewhere - hex and Torx keys - though they've given you Torx when the bolts are hex head. Not following that decision.

## First Impressions

It's a good-looking bike. Really is. Better in real life than I expected. The shapes are aggressive without being over the top. When it's dialed in with the right wheels and position sorted, this is going to be a weapon.

Would I buy one? At full price, probably not - but that's more about me than the bike. If you're after a proper aero road bike and Canyon's your thing, this is solid.
