# Cervelo S5 (2025) - Visual Comparison & Review

## What's Changed?

Cervelo have updated the S5 for 2025, and while some bike sites claim they haven't changed much, comparing them visually tells a different story. The silhouette looks similar, but there are significant changes - especially at the front end.

The head tube is now absolutely massive. It's dramatically deeper than the 2023 version, with a more aggressive angle. The forks are also much deeper, particularly at the bottom near the axle. There's a front overhang that's been extended out, clearly designed to chase aero gains.

The new handlebars have a distinctive look - almost like a Star Wars spaceship. You'll either love them or hate them. Tire clearance has increased to 34mm, and the wheels have been upgraded to Reserve's new aero offering - 57mm front (up from 52mm) and 64mm rear (up from 63mm).

## Key Specifications

| Specification | 2025 S5 | 2023 S5 |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Price** | £12,000 (Dura-Ace) | £11,700 |
| **Tire Clearance** | 34mm measured | - |
| **Wheels** | Reserve 57mm front / 64mm rear | 52mm front / 63mm rear |
| **Gearing** | 54/40 chainrings, 11-34 cassette | 52/36 chainrings, 11-30 cassette |
| **Geometry (56cm)** | Unchanged from 2023 | - |

## The "Meat Cleaver" Category

I've started thinking of these new aero bikes as "meat cleavers" - that massive, deep front end just looks like a cleaver to me. The Cervelo S5 sits firmly in this category alongside the Ridley Noah Fast and the Van Rysel aero bike.

It's interesting that while Specialized ditched the Venge to combine it with the Tarmac, and Trek merged the Madone with the Emonda, Cervelo are keeping the S5, Soloist, and R5 as distinct options. The S5 is clearly the flat-stage weapon.

## Gearing & Positioning Changes

The gearing has been significantly updated - moving to 54/40 chainrings with an 11-34 cassette. Ironically, while the UCI talks about slowing down bike racing, we've got massive gears here to go even faster.

The seat post has been redesigned to push the rider further forward - you can't set it back as far as you could on the 2023 version. This is clearly designed around modern WorldTour positioning trends.

## My Gripe

One thing that still frustrates me - despite all the aerodynamic work on these bikes, we've still got the brake hose exposed in the wind. All that development and we can't seem to solve this basic problem.

## The Verdict

The 2025 S5 is clearly faster on paper - deeper tubes, better wheels, optimized for modern positioning. But is it worth £12,000, especially £300 more than the 2023 version? 

If you're racing at a high level and need every marginal gain for flat stages and sprint finishes, then yes. For everyone else, the older S5 or something like the Soloist might make more sense.

It looks more aero than the Tarmac SL8 or the new Trek Madone, but whether that translates to real-world speed gains... well, that remains to be seen when Jonas Vingegaard races it.

**Rating:** Not rated (visual comparison only)
