## What Giant Say Each Bike Is For

**Defy Advanced SL 0 - £9,499**  
"Go long. Go fast. Superlight and silky smooth, the flagship series of the new Defy range is back to reclaim its title as the pinnacle of endurance road. It's the perfect choice for the sportive or gran fondo that's circled on your calendar."

**TCR Advanced SL 0 - £10,499**  
"From hors categorie climbs to rollers and flats, this WorldTour level race bike is the pro's choice for all-rounder performance. The all-new flagship TCR uses system integration and innovative construction methods to deliver a clear advantage on the road."

**Propel Advanced SL 0 - £9,749**  
"Unleash your sprint with 200 meters to go. Close a gap, chase back, launch a solo attack. This pro-level road machine is made for the moments that count. More aero, more adjustable, more ways to win."

## Frame & Build Philosophy

### Defy
"Free of cumbersome gimmickry, the frameset is one of the lightest in its category. With a perfect balance of high-performance reactivity and all-day comfort, it offers a 'less is more' experience for modern endurance road riding."

"Advanced SL-grade composite frame and fork are specifically engineered for endurance road riding, delivering a smooth and efficient ride quality that minimizes fatigue on long rides. The new D-Fuse components work together to further absorb road shocks and vibrations."

### TCR
"Featuring a greater stiffness-to-weight ratio than the previous generation, along with new aero tube shaping and a lighter overall weight, this uncompromising race bike delivers explosive acceleration and unyielding pedaling stiffness. The result is race-winning performance in the moments that count."

"The frameset, wheels, cockpit and other parts are engineered, developed and tested together to perform best as a system."

### Propel
"Advanced SL-grade composite frameset features Giant's pro-level composite materials and manufacturing processes. The result is 150 grams of weight savings compared to the previous generation and an even greater stiffness-to-weight advantage."

"AeroSystem Shaping, a result of CFD analysis and dynamic wind-tunnel testing, optimizes aerodynamic performance at every yaw angle. The truncated ellipse airfoil tube shapes and Contact SLR Aero cockpit produce the best overall aero performance."

---

## Cockpit & Front End

### Defy
"A new Contact D-Fuse handlebar features ergonomic shaping and an 8-degree flare for comfort and control on all-day rides."

### TCR
"The all-new OverDrive Aero steerer tube technology is combined with a Contact SLR AeroLight stem and Contact SLR handlebar to incorporate internal cable routing that also integrates the top cap, cables and spacers in a more aerodynamic, user-friendly setup."

### Propel
"Cable routing through the stem and head tube makes it quicker and easier to adjust or change cockpit components and fine-tune performance and riding position."

---

## Wheels & Tyres

### Defy
"Wide, hookless carbon rims (22.4mm inner width) are optimized for high-volume tubeless tires (up to 38mm), and a 40mm rim depth offers stable, predictable handling in crosswinds."

CADEX Ultra 40 wheels, 32mm tyres stock, 40mm max clearance.

### TCR
CADEX Max 40 wheels, 30mm tyres stock, 33mm max clearance.

### Propel
CADEX Ultra 50 wheels, 25mm tyres stock, 32mm max clearance.

---

## Aerodynamics

### Defy
No specific aero claims.

### TCR
"From the truncated ellipse shape of frameset tubing to a new cockpit design and component integration, it all adds up to a more streamlined profile that helps give the flagship TCR Advanced SL 0 model a 4.19-watt advantage over the previous generation."

### Propel
"Integrated aerodynamics - AeroSystem Shaping, a result of CFD analysis and dynamic wind-tunnel testing, optimizes aerodynamic performance at every yaw angle."

## Who Should Buy Which Bike

### Defy Advanced SL 0 - £9,499

![Giant Defy Advanced SL 0](/images/giant-defy-advanced-sl-0-2026.jpg)

**Buy the Defy if** you're doing sportives or gran fondos. Giant designed this for all-day comfort on long rides with the D-Fuse components to absorb road shocks. The 40mm tyre clearance and fender mounts make it the winter training option. The 33/46 gearing with 10-36 cassette gives you proper climbing range without grinding yourself to death. It's 15mm more stack and 15mm longer chainstays than the race bikes - more upright, more stable, less aggressive.

### TCR Advanced SL 0 - £10,499

![Giant TCR Advanced SL 0](/images/giant-tcr-advanced-sl-0-2026.jpg)

**Buy the TCR if** you want Giant's WorldTour race bike that does everything. They built this for "hors categorie climbs to rollers and flats" - it's the all-rounder. The 4.19-watt aero improvement over the previous generation plus the lighter weight means you're not sacrificing much to the Propel on flat roads, but you get a bike that climbs better. The 35/48 chainrings are proper race gearing. At £10,499 it's the most expensive but it's also the most versatile.

### Propel Advanced SL 0 - £9,749

![Giant Propel Advanced SL 0](/images/giant-propel-advanced-sl-0-2026.jpg)

**Buy the Propel if** you're racing on flat or rolling courses where aero matters more than weight. Giant built this for "unleashing your sprint with 200 meters to go" and "closing gaps" - it's a focused tool for going flat out. The 50mm wheels, AeroSystem Shaping, and aero cockpit are all optimized for maximum speed. The 37/50 chainrings are bigger than the TCR's. It's 150 grams lighter than the old Propel but it's still the heaviest of these three - you're trading weight for aerodynamics.

### The Geometry Insight

**One key thing:** The geometry is identical across each entire range. A £2,300 Defy Advanced 2 has the exact same stack, reach, and wheelbase as this £9,499 Defy Advanced SL 0. Same with the TCR and Propel ranges. Pick the bike type based on your riding, then pick your budget. The handling and fit stay the same - you're just getting lighter components and better wheels as you spend more.
