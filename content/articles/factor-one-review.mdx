# Factor ONE: The World's Fastest Road Bike (They Reckon)

Factor have launched a new aero race bike called the ONE, and they're claiming it's the fastest road bike in the world. Bold. Very bold. 

Let's see if there's any substance behind the marketing waffle.

## What's The Story Then?

The Factor ONE isn't pulled from thin air. It's basically everything they've learned from the OSTRO VAM and that Olympic record-breaking HANZO Track bike mashed together. When the UCI relaxed some key design regulations, Factor were ready and waiting with a decade's worth of CFD data and wind tunnel knowledge.

It won a stage at the Critérium du Dauphiné first time out. No twelve-month teaser campaign, no Instagram hype, just rocked up and did the job.

## The Front End - Where It Gets Weird

Right, let's talk about the elephant in the room. That fork. It's massive. Comically massive.

![Factor ONE Bayonet Fork with Chin Fairing](/images/factor-one-fork.jpg)

Factor call it a "Bayonet Fork" with a "Chin Fairing" system. It sticks way out in front with wide fork legs and this forward-projected fairing that looks like something escaped from the velodrome. The whole point is to control the turbulent air that spills off your front tyre - most bikes just let it create drag and chaos, but Factor are trying to dictate where it goes.

Their wind tunnel testing reckons this setup keeps its aerodynamic advantage even beyond 15 degrees of yaw, which is where other bikes supposedly fall apart.

Does it work? Probably. Does it look mental? Absolutely. If you turn up to the Sunday club run on this, you'd better have the legs to back it up or you'll get properly roasted.

## Geometry For How People Actually Race

Here's where Factor have done their homework. Modern WorldTour riders are using narrower bars, shoving their saddles forward, running shorter cranks - all of which pushes your weight further over the front wheel. Get the geometry wrong and you end up with a bike that handles like a shopping trolley with a wonky wheel.

Factor have decoupled the handlebar mount from the steering axis, so you get extreme reach without needing a stupidly long stem. They've adjusted the bottom bracket drop to compensate for shorter cranks and bigger tyres. The reach is 20mm longer than the OSTRO VAM, and the seat tube angle is steeper (73.5° to 77° depending on seatpost adjustment).

Even in the tiny 47cm frame, the steering geometry is identical to the 58cm. That's pretty rare and suggests they've actually thought about this properly.

## No Stem For You

Factor have binned off the traditional stem entirely. You get an integrated bar system instead - sizes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 corresponding to stem lengths of 110mm through 150mm. There's also three "High" options (1H, 2H, 3H) that add 20mm of stack if you don't want to be completely slammed.

The bars are 380mm width only. That's it. No other options. 75mm reach, 120mm drop. You can chuck on up to 15mm of spacers if needed.

Is this clever or annoying? Bit of both. It's clean, it's aero, it looks the business. But if you're between sizes or you like a 400mm bar, tough luck. And if you break it, you're buying a very expensive proprietary replacement.

## The Practical Bits (Some Good News)

Credit where it's due, Factor haven't gone completely daft on the practical side:

- **34mm tyre clearance** - that's properly generous. You could actually ride this on Yorkshire roads without your fillings falling out.
- **T47A threaded bottom bracket** - CeramicSpeed, no press-fit nonsense. Every bike mechanic just breathed a sigh of relief.
- **Normal bottle cages** - Black Inc aero ones included, but they're actual bottle cages that fit actual bottles. None of that proprietary madness.
- **UDH derailleur hanger** - sensible, standard, replaceable.
- **Di2 battery in the bottom bracket** - out of the way, integrated properly.

That said, whether you'll need Factor's blessing and a PhD to service that mental front end - or if it'll even fit in a bike box for your next trip to Majorca - is anyone's guess. Factor haven't said.

## What It Costs

Starting price is $7,599, which is about £5,900 depending on what the pound's doing that day. That gets you the frame, fork, integrated bars, seatpost, and those Black Inc SIXTY TWO wheels.

Is that expensive? Yes. Is it "remortgage your house" expensive? ...nearly. You're definitely shopping in the "serious money" aisle.

There are pricier builds going up from there with high-end groupsets, but Factor haven't published full weights for each build, which is annoying when you're trying to justify the price tag.

## The Catch (There's Always A Catch)

Let's be realistic here:

**Everything's proprietary.** Fork, bars, headset, cages - lose or break something and you're paying Factor prices for Factor parts.

**It won't make you fast if you're not already fast.** At this level we're talking marginal gains. Will it be a bit faster than a Tarmac SL8 or a Canyon Aeroad? Maybe, in certain conditions. But if you're not already racing at a decent level and putting out proper watts, it won't matter.

**The headset is 1-1/8" upper and lower.** Not tapered. That's an unusual choice for a modern race bike, probably because of that mental fork design.

## So Who's It Actually For?

Factor are pretty honest about this - it's designed for WorldTour positions and WorldTour racing. If you're the sort of rider who goes out for two or three hours, rides hard the entire time, races crits or fast road races, and wants every marginal gain available, then this makes sense.

If you're after a bike for long Sunday rides in the Dales, sportives, or anything involving cake stops? The OSTRO VAM exists for a reason. Buy that instead.

## The Verdict

The Factor ONE is a properly focused race bike. The front end looks absolutely mental but the aerodynamics seem to be genuinely sorted. The geometry makes sense for modern racing positions. They've thought about the practical stuff (threaded BB, normal bottles, decent tyre clearance). And it won a stage at the Dauphiné on debut, which suggests it's not just marketing hype.

But it's expensive, it's designed for a very specific type of riding, and you're locked into their integrated cockpit system. It's a tool for going fast in anger, not a bike for bimbling around enjoying the scenery.

**Would I buy it?** Not a chance. I'd buy a Canyon Ultimate or a Giant TCR, save many k's, and spend the rest on actually going riding. Or cake. Probably cake.

But if you're a privateer racer with the budget and you want the fastest thing available? This is probably it.

Just be prepared for your mates to take the pith out of that fork.

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5) - Brilliant if you're fast enough to need it
